There is a demo instance of the Opencast system available. If you want to get an impression on how Opencast is working try this system. You can try whatever you want, as the system gets cleaned up every 24 hours. The credentials for an admin user are automatically set. 
There are a few demo videos included by default that can be seen by everybody in the Media Module.
